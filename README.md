🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Case Study 📊
This repository contains Python scripts and data files for a comprehensive COVID-19 data analysis case study.
The scripts process and analyze global and country-specific COVID-19 data (confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries) to uncover key insights.

📂 File Structure
The project is organized into these main parts:

1️⃣ Data Files (.csv)
Raw datasets used for analysis. Keep these files in the same folder as the Python scripts.

🟢 covid_19_confirmed_v1.csv — Time-series data for confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide

⚫ covid_19_deaths_v1.csv — Time-series data for COVID-19 deaths globally

🔵 covid_19_recovered_v1.csv — Time-series data for recovered COVID-19 cases worldwide

2️⃣ Python Analysis Scripts (.py)
Organized by question number, each script covers specific analytical tasks such as loading, transforming, and analyzing data.

🔍 Question 5: Data Transformation & Country-Specific Analysis
q5_1_transform_conf_data.py — Converts confirmed cases data to long format for easier analysis

q5_2_recovery_rates_canada_australia.py — Calculates & compares recovery rates between Canada 🇨🇦 and Australia 🇦🇺

q5_3_canada_death_rates_by_province.py — Analyzes death rates across Canadian provinces

⚰️ Question 6: Deaths Data Analysis
q6_1_transform_deaths_data.py — Transforms deaths data to long format

q6_2_total_deaths_per_country.py — Calculates total deaths reported by each country

q6_3_top_5_avg_daily_deaths.py — Identifies top 5 countries with highest average daily new deaths

q6_4_us_total_deaths_over_time.py — Plots cumulative deaths over time in the United States 🇺🇸

Output: us_total_deaths_over_time.png 🖼️

📅 Question 7: Merged Dataset & Monthly Summaries
q7_1_merge_datasets.py — Merges confirmed, deaths, and recovered datasets into one DataFrame

q7_2_monthly_summary_by_country.py — Monthly summaries of cases, deaths, recoveries for all countries

q7_3_monthly_summary_us_italy_brazil.py — Detailed monthly summaries for US 🇺🇸, Italy 🇮🇹, and Brazil 🇧🇷

📈 Question 8: Advanced Analysis & Ratios
q8_1_highest_death_rates_2020.py — Lists countries with highest death rates in 2020

q8_2_south_africa_recoveries_vs_deaths.py — Compares recoveries vs deaths in South Africa 🇿🇦

q8_3_us_monthly_recovery_ratio.py — Shows monthly recovery ratio for the US 🇺🇸

3️⃣ Generated Output Files
us_total_deaths_over_time.png — Plot generated by q6_4_us_total_deaths_over_time.py showing US cumulative deaths 📈
